# Enhancing GPS Positioning Accuracy Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project implements a **Least Squares Solution** approach using data derived from **Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)**. The goal is to enhance positioning accuracy by minimizing the error in the estimated location. The script processes raw GNSS data, applies a least squares estimation method, and outputs the improved position estimates.

## Features

- **Data Processing**: Cleans and preprocesses GNSS data.
- **Least Squares Estimation**: Implements the least squares method to refine position calculations.
- **Result Analysis**: Outputs position estimates and calculates residuals for error analysis.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Durveshbaharwal/Enhanceing_GPS_ML.git
    cd Enhanceing_GPS_ML
    ```
2. **Dependencies**: Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Running the script**: Execute the Python script:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook main.ipynb
    ```

## Usage

- The script reads GNSS data from a source file.
- Applies the least squares method to estimate positions.
- Outputs the refined positions along with error metrics.
